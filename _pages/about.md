### About Me
\
Hi, my name is Pierre Guilleminot, I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bioengineering/) and the [Centre of Neurotechnology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/neurotechnology "The best CDT") of [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). I am a member of the [Sensory Neuroengineering Group](http://www.bg.ic.ac.uk/research/reichenbach/) led by [Pr.Tobias Reichenbach](https://reichenbach.bg-research.cc.ic.ac.uk/team.html), currently based both in the Departement of Bioengineering of Imperial College London and in the [Department for Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering (AIBE)](https://www.tf.fau.eu/faculty-of-engineering/departments-and-chairs/artificial-intelligence-in-biomedical-engineering/) of Friedrich-Alexander-University(FAU) Erlangen-Nuremberg.


My PhD research focuses on combining sensory signals in order to modulate speech comprehension in challenging conditions and understanding the neural mechanisms of the multisensory perception and comprehension of natural speech. In my work, I am combining cognitive neuroscience,signal processing and machine learning in order to design experiments and model EEG response to multisensory stimuli.

Aside from my main research, I also work on side projects and supervise Master students, exploring brain oscillations and sensory substitution.
