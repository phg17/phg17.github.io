Brain whisperer, photoshopper extraordinaire, ASMR superstar, depressing drawing professional.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Neurotechnology at Imperial College London. I like to touch people while whispespering really low into their ear and measure how creeped out they are. I also Photoshop glasses onto dogs.
