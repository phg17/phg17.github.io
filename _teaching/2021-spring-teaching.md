Brain-Machine Interface
======

With the other Teaching Assistant and Pr.Claudia Clopath, we organized a BMI competition where students were provided with neural data from a monkey and had to decode its movement. The competition was a great opportunity for students to implement their own code, try and compare different ML methods and learn how to handle neural spikes data.
