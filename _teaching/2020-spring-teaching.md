# List of Spring 2021 Courses

## Brain-Machine Interface

With the other Teaching Assistant and Pr.Claudia Clopath, we organized a BMI competition where students were provided with neural data from a monkey and had to decode its movement. The competition was a great opportunity for students to implement their own code, try and compare different ML methods and learn how to handle neural spikes data.

## Stochastic Processes (Modelling in Biology, 2nd Semester)


For this part of the course (given by Dr.Thomas Ouldridge), Teaching Assistants taught the students different concepts related to Stochastic Processes(discrete/continuous state/time processes, markov chain, graph theory...) and their application to Biology(DNA model, population regulation or disease transmission...).
